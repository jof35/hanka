  <h2>Chimney Cake</h2>
  <p>2 x 7 g sachets dried yeast</p>
<p>275 g (1¼ cups) caster sugar </p>
<p>3 egg yolks</p>
<p>150 g unsalted butter, melted</p>
<p>500 g (3⅓ cups) plain flour</p>
<p>vegetable oil, to brush</p>
<p>330 g (1 cup) Nutella, warmed</p>
<p>cocoa powder, to dust</p>
<p>Combine yeast, milk and 1 tbsp sugar in a bowl. Set aside in a warm, draught-free place for 5 minutes or until mixture bubbles. Whisk 2 tbsp sugar with egg yolks and butter in a jug, add yeast mixture and stir to combine.</p>

<p>Place flour, milk mixture and ¼ tsp salt in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with a dough hook. Stir to combine, then mix on low speed until a firm dough forms. Mix on medium speed for a further 5 minutes or until smooth and elastic. Or, knead by hand for 10 minutes. Place dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draught-free place for 45 minutes or until doubled in size.</p>

<p>Preheat oven to 220°C. Turn out onto a lightly floured work surface and roll out to a 5 mm-thick 24 cm x 40 cm rectangle. Trim edges, then cut into 8 x 3 cm-wide strips. Join 2 strips at short edges, pressing to seal.</p>

<p>Place 1 slim 13 cm x 5 cm empty soft drink can vertically in the centre of a large piece of doubled foil. Fold foil up to meet top edge of other side, then roll can from right to left to encase in foil. Repeat with remaining 3 cans; each should have one sealed end and one open. Gather foil at open end and twist like a bon bon; this will be used as a handle to turn and will help remove can. Brush foil with oil.</p>

<p>Starting from one end, wrap each dough strip around a can on an angle, tucking in dough at each end to prevent unravelling. Don't overlap dough.</p>

<p>Place remaining 1 cup sugar on a plate. Brush kurtosh liberally with oil, then roll in sugar, pressing to coat well. Place on their sides on a lined oven tray and bake, turning halfway through cooking, for 10 minutes or until golden.</p>

<p>Remove from oven, stand upright and, using foil at top, twist can to remove. Using a knife, spread ¼ cup Nutella around inside of each kurtosh. Dust with cocoa to serve.</p>
